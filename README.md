WP Obelisk Player is a WordPress plugin which allows you to create music playlists.

You can easily compose playlists and add songs to them. Later on, each signed in user can add the admin predefined songs to their own favourites playlist and rearrange them simply by drag and drop.

You only need to add the **[obelisk_playlist]** shortcode anywhere you want and the plugin will show up.
